## Overview

Develop a detailed, well-researched, and well-reasoned AI-powered marketing strategy tailored to your company type that wants to thrive over the next 5 years.

## The Prompt

From first principles, develop a detailed, well-researched, and well-reasoned AI-powered marketing strategy tailored to a **[company type]** that wants to thrive over the next 5 years.

### 📌 Examples to customize:
**[company type]** → "B2B SaaS company," "bootstrapped ecommerce startup," "mid-size legal firm," "freelance design collective," etc.

## Core Framework

Organize all marketing tasks and workflows into three core categories:

### ✅ All Done by AI 
Fully automated tasks where humans are (or will soon be) unnecessary

### 🤝 AI + Human 
AI generates the first draft; humans optimize, edit, and deploy

### 🧠 Human Only 
Deeply human tasks AI won't master (e.g. relationship-building, vision)

## Marketing Funnel Coverage

Cover the entire marketing funnel, including (but not limited to):
- Audience research
- Content creation
- SEO + SEM
- Email + CRM campaigns
- Paid ads
- Social media
- Branding + creative strategy
- Funnel optimization
- Lead nurturing + sales enablement
- Reporting + performance analysis

## Task Analysis Framework

For each task in each bucket, outline:

### 🧩 What the task is and why it fits this category

### 🛠️ Best tools or AI models (current or upcoming)
*e.g., Jasper, Claude, GPT-5, HubSpot AI, Surfer, Deepseek, ChatGPT+Browse*

### 🔄 How to implement or transition to this model

### ⚠️ Risks/blind spots 
*e.g., hallucinations, legal/regulatory risks, brand tone mismatch*

### 📈 How to measure success 
*KPIs, cost/time savings, output quality, team satisfaction*

## 🧪 Bonus Customization Ideas

Let users personalize the strategy based on these optional fields:

### 🎯 Target audience 
*e.g. "enterprise buyers in healthcare"*

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team size and skill level 
*e.g. "3-person team with basic AI experience"*

### ⚙️ Current stack 
*e.g. "using Notion, HubSpot, Canva, and Ahrefs"*

### 🪙 Budget level 
*e.g. "low-cost, high-leverage strategy"*

## 📌 Final Objective

The output should be a clear, forward-looking roadmap that helps **[company type]** decide:
- Where to automate confidently
- Where to collaborate with AI
- Where to retain a uniquely human edge
